The primary goal of this research is to develop geolocation methodologies for Northwest Atlantic groundfish based on the Hidden Markov Model, with direct application to Atlantic cod, yellowtail flounder, and monkfish. With the vast amount of tagging data generated by many fish tagging programs, parallelism is required to speed up the geolocation analyses.\r\n\r\n* Quantifying connectivity in Buzzards Bay with application to the study of recruitment variability in the bay scallop *Argopecten irradians* (2010–2013; Woods Hole Sea Grant)\r\n\r\nTo investigate the extent to which the fluctuations of bay scallop population may be due to, yearly variations in the transport of scallop larvae from spawning areas to suitable juvenile habitat (settlement zones), a high-resolution hydrodynamic model was used to drive an individual-based Lagrangian tracking model of scallop larval transport. The model results identify spawning areas from which larvae have the greatest probability of transport to juvenile habitat, which can be use by fishery managers to increase scallop populations either locally or over a broad area.\r\n\r\n### EDUCATION\r\nPh.D., School for Marine Science and Technology (SMAST), University of Massachusetts Dartmouth\r\nNew Bedford, MA, USA (2014-present)\r\n\r\n\r\nM.S., School for Marine Science and Technology (SMAST), University of Massachusetts Dartmouth\r\nNew Bedford, MA, USA (2010-2013) \r\nThesis: Quantifying Connectivity in Buzzards Bay with Application to the Study of Recruitment Variability in the Bay Scallop (Argopecten irradians)\r\n\r\n\r\nB.S., Marine Science, School of Atmospheric Science, Nanjing University of Information Science & Tech- nology (NUIST)\r\nNanjing, China (2006-2010)\r\n\r\n### PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\n**Liu, C**., Cowles, G., Churchill, J. and Stokesbury, K.
