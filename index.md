<!-- ### PROJECTS
* __Investigating the stock structure and life history of Atlantic halibut, a Species of Concern off New England (2017; NOAA S-K Grant)__

   The goal is to investigate the stock structure and life history of Atlantic halibut by tagging and collecting biological samples from halibut caught off Cape Cod. Stock structure will be investigated by observing movement traced via innovative geolocation of halibut tagged with pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs). PSAT data will be used to reveal halibut seasonal habitat occupancy and behavior. I am charged with the development of geolocation methodology for halibut using PSAT data and interpretation of results with respect to their behavior, movements, and stock structure. This research will improve our understanding of halibut population dynamics and the status of the resource. 

* __Using archival tagging data to develop geolocation methodologies (2014-present; NOAA S-K Grant)__

   The geolocation process is to infer geographical locations of marine fish by comparing environmental data archived by electronic tags attached to fish with regional environmental data derived from a model and/or observations. The primary goal of this research is to develop [geolocation methodologies](https://github.com/cliu3/hmm_smast) for Northwest Atlantic groundfish based on the Hidden Markov Model, with direct application to Atlantic cod, yellowtail flounder, and monkfish. 

* __Quantifying connectivity in Buzzards Bay with application to the study of recruitment variability in the bay scallop *Argopecten irradians* (2010–2013; Woods Hole Sea Grant)__

   To investigate the extent to which the fluctuations of bay scallop population may be due to, yearly variations in the transport of scallop larvae from spawning areas to suitable juvenile habitat (settlement zones), a high-resolution hydrodynamic model was used to drive [an individual-based Lagrangian tracking model](https://github.com/cliu3/fiscm) of scallop larval transport. The model results identify spawning areas from which larvae have the greatest probability of transport to juvenile habitat, which can be use by fishery managers to increase scallop populations either locally or over a broad area.
